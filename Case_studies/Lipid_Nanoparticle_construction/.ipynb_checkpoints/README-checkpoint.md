### Lipid Nanoparticle Construction

Here in you find the commands used for constructing the LNP systems studied in the [original paper](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bf4n8).
Please be aware that we provide only **_guidelines_** for building LNP structures, **_NOT_** an automated protocol. 
The component ratios and structural details may need to be adjusted based on your specific scientific question. These adjustments often require manual (hardcoded) changes to the scripts.

#### Commands used for setting up an LNP with an inverse hexagonal core. 
Input files for the three LNPs simulated in the paper can also be found in this folder.

#### Commands used for constructing a 'Bleb' like LNP.
Note that this is a showcase protocol not optimized to run Molecular Dynamics on the resulting structure.
