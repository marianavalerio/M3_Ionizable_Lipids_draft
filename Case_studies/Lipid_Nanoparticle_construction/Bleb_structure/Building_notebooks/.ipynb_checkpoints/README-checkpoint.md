### Important Notes for Users

Please be aware that these Jupyter Notebooks only provides **_guidelines_** for building a "Bleb"-LNP structure. It is **_NOT_** an automated protocol. 
The component ratios and structural details may need to be adjusted based on your specific scientific question. These adjustments often require manual (hardcoded) changes to the scripts.

Even to run the current guidelines successfully, you may need to tune tolerances, adjust lipid ratios, and make other parameter modifications.

#### Knowledge Prerequisites

To use these guidelines effectively, you should have in depth knowledge of the following tools:
- GROMACS
- MDAnalysis
- Packmol
- TS2CG
- freud
- mdvwhole

If you are not familiar with these tools, please complete introductory tutorials for each before attempting to use this protocol.
